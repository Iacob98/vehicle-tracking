-- ============================================================================
-- PART 1: Make buckets private (disable public access)
-- ============================================================================

-- Make all buckets private
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = false WHERE name IN ('vehicles', 'documents', 'expenses', 'penalties');

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 2: Add RLS Policies for 'documents' bucket
-- ============================================================================

-- Allow authenticated users to upload documents
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload documents"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Users can view documents if they own them (check organization via user_metadata)
-- Note: This assumes file path includes organization_id or we check via authenticated role
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their organization's documents"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- Users can update their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their organization's documents"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'

-- Users can delete their own documents
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their organization's documents"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 3: Add RLS Policies for 'vehicles' bucket
-- ============================================================================

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload vehicle files"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'vehicles' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view vehicle files"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete vehicle files"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'vehicles' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 4: Add RLS Policies for 'expenses' bucket
-- ============================================================================

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload expense files"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'expenses' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view expense files"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT

CREATE POLICY "Users can update expense files"

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete expense files"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'expenses' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 5: Add RLS Policies for 'penalties' bucket
-- ============================================================================

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload penalty files"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'penalties' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view penalty files"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'penalties' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'

CREATE POLICY "Users can update penalty files"

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete penalty files"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'penalties' AND
  auth.role() = 'authenticated'
);

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 6: Service Role Bypass (for backend operations)
-- ============================================================================

-- Service role can access all buckets
CREATE POLICY "Service role can access all storage"
ON storage.objects FOR ALL
TO service_role
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- ============================================================================
-- PART 7: Verification
-- ============================================================================

-- Verify buckets are now private
-- SELECT name, public FROM storage.buckets;
-- Expected: all public = false

-- Verify policies exist
-- SELECT bucket_id, name, definition
-- FROM storage.policies
-- ORDER BY bucket_id, name;
-- Expected: 17 policies (4 per bucket Ã— 4 buckets + 1 service role)

COMMIT;

-- ============================================================================
-- IMPORTANT NOTES
-- ============================================================================

-- 1. FILE PATH STRUCTURE:
--    For better security, consider organizing files by organization:
--    {bucket}/{organization_id}/{filename}
--    Then update policies to check path:
--    name LIKE (SELECT organization_id FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid()) || '/%'

-- 2. SIGNED URLs:
--    Since buckets are now private, use signed URLs in the application:
--    const { data } = await supabase.storage
--      .from('documents')
--      .createSignedUrl(filePath, 3600); // 1 hour expiry

-- 3. MIGRATION IMPACT:
--    Existing public URLs will STOP WORKING after this migration
--    Update application code to use signed URLs or implement
--    organization-based path checking

-- 4. FUTURE IMPROVEMENT:
--    Add organization_id to file metadata and check in policies:
--    (storage.foldername(name))[1] = (auth.jwt() -> 'user_metadata' ->> 'organization_id')
